# stock-analysis

Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze returns of 12 stock securities and to create a Macro in VBA to expedite searching. \
This was done to inform future investments for someone seeking investment advice. First the DQ security was analyzed, then all 12 securities were studied. Then we had a chance to refactor code to accomplish the same task. 

Results

In 2017, all stocks but one, TERP had positive returns. TERP lost -7.21% of value. 
In 2018, there were 2 stocks under study with positive returns: ENPH with a +81.92% return and RUN with +83.95% return all other stocks lost value. 
The timer for each year of analysis was essentially equal at about 1/4 of a second. 
Refactored code would not run succesfully, which makes little sense because the point of error was provided as code. 

Summary

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Generally speaking, refactoring code allows us to build efficiency into our code, to reduce redundancy and improve speed. It can also, I imaging teach us different logical ways to approach and solve similar analytical challenges. 
Because of my obviously limited knowledge of VBA, my refactored VBA script, when complete will no doubt be less efficient than the code we were walked through in the course. 
I ran into a lot of errors when running the code that I couldn't explain or get past. Nonetheless this module was helpful in demysitifying VBA.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Writing code in VBA offers a more efficient way to analyzing large spread sheets than coding in excel alone. This is a powerful tool.
I encountered several errors both with the original code as were taught in the module and the refactored code. Samples of those screen shots are shared in the Resources folder. 

Limitations
Refactoring code with limited knowledge and resources can be very frustrating but I look forward to seeing what the sought after correct answers will be and continuing to work on this after today.
VBA errors became frustrating when doing this module as it slowed down the process of getting to an end point, time was lost in researching refactoring strategies.
